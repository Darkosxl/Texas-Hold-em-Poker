# Texas Hold'em Poker
 
# Game developed by Darkwarro(@Darkosxl) & 3 classmates as a project in RC
was intended to be a full-house poker platform with multiple games 
but this was the only finished prototype fully playable, only the first game can
be accessed. It is played versus NPC AI's that are functional and challenging.
